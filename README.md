# Bash boilerplate

A starting point for command-line scripts--structure, environment, and
facilities for logging and command line parsing.

    $ ./script.sh
    ./script.sh greet|dismiss name

    $ ./script.sh greet McCoy
    [2015-03-08T09:17:28-0700] - So then I says, 'Top o' the morning to ye, McCoy!'

    $ ./script.sh fail hard
    [2015-03-08T09:16:09-0700] - FATAL: 'I don't feel so well....'
